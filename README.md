# GoneTooSoon
This is the website for the Gone Too Soon artwork by Rahul Kakarlapudi

This series delves into the profound significance and precarious vulnerability of keystone species, such as lions, tigers, polar bears, elephants, and rhinos, which exert an essential influence on the balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. In their absence, some ecosystems may fail to adapt to environmental changes, jeopardizing their sustainability. These pivotal species can be mighty predators or unassuming plants, but their disappearance can spell disaster for the ecosystem's survival. Unfortunately, human greed and the illegal wildlife trade have pushed numerous species, including elephants, rhinos, tigers, and leopards, to the brink of extinction. Their ivory, horns, and skin are highly coveted in the black market, and some of their body parts are even erroneously associated with medicinal and healing properties. This series serves as a tribute to the endangered species and aims to raise awareness of their critical importance.

This project melds the art of classical drawing and photography, comprising a collection of long-exposure light portraits of endangered animals. The artist drew each subject in a light-proof room, capturing their essence using a Canon Rebel T3i and a Pentax (35mm) camera. The artist's goal is to underscore the vanishing of these remarkable creatures from our planet while showcasing their magnificence and significance.

“I don't know how to exactly describe the experience of working on this project. I was dancing in the dark. Like playing a violin, a symphony only I could hear. A private concert just for me. I fell in love with not the result but the process of mastering my artistry.”
